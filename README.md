# Disk-Space-monitor-mail
Easy solution to receive a email notification if your disk is getting full. I use it in some Virtual Private Server (vps)
Simply set a crontab to check the disk space everyday or with the frequent that you need.
Remember to change the email where you want to receive the notifications.
